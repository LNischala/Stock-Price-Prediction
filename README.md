# Stock Price Prediction

## Overview
This project implements a **Stock Price Prediction Model** using **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks** for time-series forecasting. The model is trained on historical stock price data to predict future trends.

## Features
- 📈 **Stock Price Forecasting** – Predicts future stock prices using LSTM.
- 📊 **Data Preprocessing** – Handles missing values, normalizes data, and prepares it for training.
- 📉 **Trend Analysis** – Implements a 30-day moving average for smoother trend observation.
- 🕒 **Time-Series Modeling** – Utilizes LSTM networks to capture temporal dependencies.
- 🏦 **Real Market Dataset** – Trained on the **CAC40 stock market dataset** from Kaggle.
- 📷 **Candlestick Chart Visualization** – Uses **mplfinance** to generate candlestick charts for better stock trend insights.

## Tech Stack
- **Python** – Core programming language.
- **TensorFlow & Keras** – Building and training the LSTM model.
- **NumPy & Pandas** – Data preprocessing and handling.
- **Matplotlib & mplfinance** – Data visualization and candlestick charting.


## Usage
- Load and preprocess stock market data.
- Train the LSTM model on historical stock prices.
- Predict future stock trends.
- Visualize results using candlestick charts.
